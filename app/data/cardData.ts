                 Title: Aaliyah Brown - Project Engineer at Transportation Resources

                 An MC2 STEM High School graduate who discovered her passion for engineering during a high school summer program, stating "If I would have known the support would be as broad and as abundant as the opportunities, I think that would have helped me a little bit more."

           Question: What is her educational background?
                 She holds an undergraduate degree in engineering technology and a master's in engineering management from Auburn University.

           Question: Tell us about your mentorship experience?
                 She's had several mentors throughout her career, with her most significant mentor being the person who hired her as an intern at Rockwell during her junior year of high school. This relationship has become her longest-standing mentorship.

           Question: What does STEM mean to you?
                 To Aaliyah, STEM represents "figuring out how things work and then wanting to make those better." She emphasizes that while STEM encompasses science and technology, its principles can be applied to any aspect of life.

           Question: What challenges did you face in your STEM journey?
                 She acknowledges struggling with finding support during her college years. However, she was drawn to engineering because of the diverse opportunities it offered. She reflects that understanding the available support system earlier would have been beneficial.

           Question: What advice do you have for the next generation?
                 Her message to brown and black children is clear and encouraging: "not to shy away from the challenge and understand that especially being brown and black children, that the opportunities that will be able to come to them from pursuing this career are definitely worth the hard work that it takes to get there."

                  Title: Grady Burrows - Executive Director of Mosaic Tech Movement

                  An engineer and IT professional who leads Mosaic Tech Movement, providing greater access to computer and data science programs for high school and college students, believing that "Do not for one second think that you're less than, that you're incapable of, or that you cannot achieve whatever it is that you want to do."

                  Question: What drew you to your current path?
                  I always liked math and science, and I enjoyed technology. I just liked the way that technology was making things better. Technological innovations were taking place in the world around me, and I knew that I wanted to have a hand in that somewhere and somehow. As I got a little older in high school, I started thinking about engineering as a discipline to study in college. And somebody said, well, of all the engineering disciplines, industrial and systems engineering is the discipline that really best melds and meshes technology and people together. And I'm a people person, I enjoy working with people. I said, wow, if I can study anything, I think industrial engineering will be the discipline for me.

                  Question: What challenges did you face during your education?
                  College in general, it wasn't easy. Definitely, it was a challenge. But I did have the ability to participate in a pre-engineering program at Ohio State for minority students. It was a seven week program called Profess, and it allowed me to go to school with about 15 other students coming in, and our cohort was one that locked arms together. We found our way through college together, and we really stood side by side. We helped each other out, and without it I don't think I would have made it.

                  Question: Why is finding support important for STEM students?
                  It's huge because there are a lot of people and a lot of support systems out there to help you, but you can't live on an island by yourself. You have to reach out and raise your hand and say, I need help, or I would like to network and find other people who look like me, who think like me and who might be able to understand my perspective or where I'm coming from. Many of us have walked those same roads and bridges, and crossed some of those same obstacles that you might cross. So believe me when I say that by reaching out and talking to other people who are a little older and who have gone through this before, you can gain some really good insight and wisdom and help in navigating some of the challenges you might face as you pursue a STEM career.

                 Title: Layla Joseph - Research Assistant at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine

                 A Stanford University graduate whose STEM journey began with her first mentor – her mother – leading her from childhood curiosity to a future in medicine through the MD/PhD program.

                 Question: What inspired your path to becoming a physician?
                 I think first and foremost, I would credit my mom with a lot of the path that I've taken because she, I don't know how much you know about her, but she is very involved in STEM outreach and a lot of the work she's done throughout my entire life has been getting kids, particularly those from marginalized backgrounds interested in STEM and seeing themselves in STEM careers. I remember going to a pre-surgical camp at the Cleveland Natural History Museum one summer, and that was particularly inspiring for me. While growing up, I participated in STEM camps with great learning experiences every summer.

                 Question: How has representation influenced your journey?
                 I was fortunate to meet many doctors and educators, particularly Black doctors and educators who really showed how to pave the way. It's more easy to feel confident in pursuing a particular career, if you see people who look like you.

                 Question: What message do you have for others following this path?
                 "It's so necessary for people like you to enter the workforce and to pursue these careers. And I know it's hard and these institutions were not built for us. And in many ways, they were built to keep us out. And so that makes it all the more powerful that we cast that aside and say, 'No, I deserve to be here and this is where I belong.' Find your community. It is out there. We really do need you in this area and the fields are made so much richer and so much stronger by your presence."

                 Question: What practical advice can you offer to students interested in STEM?
                 If you aren't privileged to have a mom or family member who is deeply involved in STEM experiences, the responsibility sometimes does fall on you to seek those opportunities out. But I would suggest finding city resources, find out what the surrounding colleges and universities offer and see what opportunities are out there because I think a lot of these places have great ways for young people to get involved in STEM activities. A lot depends on knowing the right place to look. And so I think if students are inspired by something they're learning in school, I would highly recommend for them to look for resources online and look for opportunities in their city or region to learn more. Summer is the perfect time to capitalize on both your freedom to relax and explore some of the things you can't do during school.

                 Title: Althea Ganaway - Program Manager, Additive Manufacturing Program at Cuyahoga Community College

                 A multidisciplinary scholar and innovator who believes "STEM is everywhere around us," while pursuing her goal to join the ranks of the nation's 500 African-American women architects.

                 Question: Tell us about your educational journey?
                 I actually have four degrees, two undergrad from Kent, one in history and one in architecture. And then I also have two masters degrees from Cleveland State, one in history and one in urban planning, design and development. And then for the additive manufacturing portion, I actually hold the Additive Manufacturing Fundamentals Certificate given out by ESAME. And I'm going to look into getting my PHD, probably in urban studies and then another in order to be a registered architect. And just because I like to do milestones, there's only 500 black women in the United States that are registered architects.

                 Question: What's your perspective on STEM?
                 So when I think of STEM, it means everything to me. Sometimes people try to limit it and put it in this little box and say it only applies to engineering...It applies to people who are in any type of field that requires math or science. And that's not necessarily true.

                 Question: How do you see STEM integrating with other fields?
                 What about a person who's into arts that wants to do it a different way? They want to 3D print their art? For me, STEM just means that we are looking at how we collaborate multiple different subjects and how those all work together and how we integrate them, so it's not about one thing in one area, it's about how we take everything that we do. Because at this point what isn't run by a computer? I mean, think of all the apps on your phone, call your house, close your windows. I mean, what can't you do?

                 Title: Leon Wilson - Chief of Digital Innovation & CIO at the Cleveland Foundation

                 A digital visionary who views STEM as his form of art, emphasizing that "We're afraid to ask for help because we might feel like we're inferior. Ask for help. There are people out there to help you understand."

                 Question: What's your perspective on the different aspects of STEM?
                 When we say STEM, sometimes we focus on one of the four letters, but not all four simultaneously. When I was in college, it was the "E". Everybody wanted to be an engineer: electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering. Now, everybody wants to be the "T", technology: I.T. technology, digital. But if you think about it, the "S", the science and the "M", the mathematics are the anchors– bookends that allow you to get into "T" to get into "E." We need chemists, we need biologists. We need a lot of other things, we need all of it. We're not just not fixated on one particular area of STEM. Think about what you're interested in, what you're gravitated to, what you think you will enjoy getting up every day, doing and thriving on. But at the same time, don't be afraid that you might pivot. You may start off as a biologist and become a coder. You may start up as a coder and get into the "M" piece of it so you may bounce around.

                 Question: What challenges have you faced in your STEM journey?
                 As a person of color, you're going to struggle with sometimes being the only person in the room in those particular fields. Seek a social network, seek a support network. That's what got me through college is that I wasn't the only one there. There were three other students that were African-Americans from the Detroit area that work in computer science, same time I was. And we made sure that each of us graduated and we stay in touch right now. Join social groups, whether it's the National Society of Black Engineers which covers all the STEMS, if you will separate maybe mathematics, but seek a support network because you're going to struggle, you're going to hit roadblocks, you're going to say "I may not be able to do this." And if you have people from your tribe that can tell you that I'm struggling with you. Let's struggle together, you will more likely persevere and get through it.

                 Question: What does STEM mean to you personally?
                 I always say that STEM to me is my form of art. I always say I'm not creative as an artist, but I'm creative when it comes to technology. So STEM to me is another form of experiencing creativity and freedom for me as far as how my brain is wired.
